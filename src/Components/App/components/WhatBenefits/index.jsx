          Well, there is a trick for certain phones – you need to launch settings from a USB-OTG cable/drive, do the
          factory reset in the Backup settings and clean up all data related to Google accounts. Do the reset again and
          Factory Reset Protection is bypassed successfully, now you can setup your device anew.
